# What is this supposed to be?

This was supposed to be a project that:
1. Fetched liquidity pool and token analytics.
2. Utilized that data to train an ML model which would then be able to generate signals for events like add liquidity, remove liquidity etc
3. Those signals would then be feed to a automated system to carry out the actions.

# What it is
Unfortunately, it proven out of my current technical depth. So it's fallen into being a data scraper and a simple frontend for displaying that data.  

# Notes

  The logic for taking on chain actions ie adding, removing liquidity, swapping tokens was copied from here

  The logic for finding liquidity pools and performing some initial analysis was copied from here.

# Future plans?
No clue. If you found this, have fun.
